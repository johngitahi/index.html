	  <h1>Bio</h1>
	  <p>
	    I'm a 19 year old Kenyan with an interest in a lot of things including computers, design, economics, history & governments, medicine, among others. I have always been eager to learn and explore new things, to see things from different perspectives, and to understand things.
	  </p>
	  <p>
	    Currently, I am a nursing student at a Kenyan University.
	  </p>
	  <p>
	    I love my family, and I draw a lot of strength from their support. I learn a lot from my father and mother about life.
	  </p>
	  <p>
	    I think a lot about a perfect open society and how living in that world would be. I aspire to do a lot of good to a lot of people and to do work that will improve peoples' lives.
	  </p>
	  <p>
	    Leisurely, I read, design and write software, and sometimes play around with water colors while being guided by whims of randomness in a hobby i'd love to call painting.
