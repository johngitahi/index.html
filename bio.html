	    I was born in Western Kenya in 2004.
	    I have an interest in a lot of things including the computer,
	    design, economics, history & governments, medicine,
	    among others. I have always been eager to learn and explore
	    new things, to see things from different perspectives,
	    and to understand things.
	  </p>
	  <p>
	    Currently, I am a nursing student at a Kenyan University.
	  </p>
	  <p>
	    I love my family, and I draw a lot of strength from their
	    support. I learn a lot from my father and mother about life.
	  </p>
	  <p>
	    I think a lot about a perfect open society and how living
	    in that world would be. I aspire to do a lot of good to a
	    lot of people and to do work that will improve peoples'
	    lives.
	  </p>
	  <p>
	    Leisurely, I read, design and write software, and sometimes
	    play around with water colors while being guided
	    by whims of randomness in a hobby i'd love to call painting.
